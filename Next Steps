The Next Steps

Declan O., project manager

Progress has been going fairly smoothly. Effectively everything, land, person generation, reproduction, death, and display is finished.

All that I know is left is to complete actions and put everything together into a full program.

And at that point, all that would be left is to test and improve if necessary.

Two things of note that will also need to be done is cycles and possibly add in any other ideas, such as more stats. The latter, of course, would only be done after testing.

Regarding cycles, we have yet to definitively decide on how long a cycle lasts, both in-simulation and out.

As always, I shall continue to document this process. And play minesweeper.

I'm not entirely sure if I wrote this as I was supposed to. Oh well.
