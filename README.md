Project codename: CIV VII Bible

### People

Currently, we are working on creating people’s stats and automatically increasing their age.

Semi-permanent stats:
* Speed
* Stamina
* Strength
* Industriousness (changed to ingenuity)
* Intelligence
* Curiosity
* Awareness
* Aggression
* Attractiveness(?)
* Necessary Consumption
* Weight
* Height

Impermanent stats:
* Age

Semi-permanent stats are mostly rigid, but can change based on certain events/actions(?).
Impermanent stats constantly change. eg: age increases each cycle

Currently, we are experimenting with stats affecting other stats. ie: A higher speed stat means that it’s more likely for a Sim to have higher stamina.

Max is working on reproduction (not the most rehearsed on the topic).

Suggested naming systems:
* Adding the numbers of the parents?
* ???
* uhhh

Height and weight system implemented. More height means higher speed and higher awareness. Higher weight (muscle mass) increases strength, but decreases speed(?).

Weight issues have arisen with error messages (EDIT: Weight issues solved).

Similarly, reproduction is having some issues with creating a child that is a person (EDIT: Problems solved(?) with the implementation of the Child class).

Fortnite 2

Some issues with stats being way too low or high when it comes to several generations have arisen... But hey, it's evolution!

## MEETINGS

Group meeting 1: Discussion of current state of our programs and what to do going forward.

Character creation is effectively done (for now).

We're going to work on a small test area to... well, test the programs first.

"Yoshi has committed several crimes including: shooting an unarmed man in the streets, tax evasion, statutory rape, multiple cases of homicide, vandalism, robbery, failure to stay at the crime scene, aggravated assault, arson, theft, motor vehicle theft, first and second degree murder, evasion of police forces, and multiple breaches of probation. Yoshi has arms in his possession such as : an AR-15, exactly 15 Glock-9s, an RPG-7, 3 M4-A1s, no less than 18 C7-17s, and rumoured nuclear capabilities Yoshi owns several gangs and mafias, however it is unknown how many are under his control. Many believe that the 2009 Vancouver gang war, one of the arguable biggest gang wars in history, was created by Yoshi in order to quote "Cull the weak". In conclusion Yoshi is one of the most deadly men to ever live, along with his several gangs, Yoshi is never truly alone, meaning that any force sent to eliminate him has only resulted in the deaths of those sent." - Stone
