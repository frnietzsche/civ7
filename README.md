### People

Currently, we are working on creating people’s stats and automatically increasing their age.

Semi-permanent stats:
* Speed
* Stamina
* Strength
* Industriousness (changed to ingenuity)
* Intelligence
* Curiosity
* Awareness
* Aggression
* Attractiveness(?)
* Necessary Consumption
* Weight
* Height

Impermanent stats:
* Age

Semi-permanent stats are mostly rigid, but can change based on certain events/actions(?).
Impermanent stats constantly change. eg: age increases each cycle

Currently, we are experimenting with stats affecting other stats. ie: A higher speed stat means that it’s more likely for a Sim to have higher stamina.

Max is working on reproduction.

Suggested naming systems:
* Adding the numbers of the parents?
* ???

Height and weight system implemented. More height means higher speed and higher awareness. Higher weight (muscle mass) increases strength, but decreases speed(?).

Weight issues have arisen with errors (EDIT: Weight issues solved).

Similarly, reproduction is having some issues with creating a child that is a person.
